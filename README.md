# Test these Algorithms

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the EHMIN algorithm:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dukelw/algorithm-for-mining-high-utility-itemsets-from-unstable-negative-profit-databases.git
```

### Step 2: Test the Algorithms

To run EHMIN, navigate to the `ehmin.py` file and execute the following command in the terminal:

```sh
py ehmin.py
```

The result will be save at ehmin_output.txt.

To run EMHUN, navigate to the `emhun.py` file and execute:

```sh
py emhun.py
```

The result will be save at emhun_output.txt.

To run other algorithm, do the similar step with their name.
